----------------------------------MAKEFILE NOTES-------------------------------------
----REQUIREMENTS--------------------------
    f2py (should come with numpy)
    FORTRAN compiler (gfortran works well)
------------------------------------------
----MAKEFILE INSTRUCTIONS-----------------
Before the program can be run the FORTRAN modules on the fortran_scripts directory
must be compiled. A makefile has been included in the directory to compile all of the
.f90 files contained in the directory into one file.

To compile the FORTRAN files execute the make command on the main directory or in the 
fortran_scripts directory. The makefile should be capable of distinguishing the OS 
from Linux or Windows. VER is the python version variable. Running make VER=2.7 will 
compile the codefor use with python 2.7. Running make without any other arguments will 
compile the code for the default python being used in the machine.

The make clean object will clean up all binary files in both the fortran_scripts and 
scripts directories.
------------------------------------------
Works equally with Python 2.x or 3.x just make sure to make the proper adjustments on
the Makefile to the VER variable.
